# Task-Management-System-Linked-List-Stack-Queue-
This project implements a simple console-based task manager that allows the user to maintain a set of tasks, mark tasks as performed, undo performed tasks, and generate a summary report file. The project is designed to practice dynamic memory allocation and core data structures: linked lists, stacks, and queues.
